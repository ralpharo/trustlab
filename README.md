Assignment for Trustlab assignment. 

Here is my approach: 

1. I installed a python package that searches the database for you.
2. first look at the databse based on month and look through all of the articles in their that have HTML tags like 'covid 19' or 'pandemic'
3. the package downloaded has an option to return data into a pandas framwork. so doing that and also filtering more there.
